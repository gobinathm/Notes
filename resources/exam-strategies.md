# Exam Day Strategies

Proven strategies to help you perform your best during certification exams.

## Before the Exam

### The Week Before

**Final preparation:**
- [ ] Complete 2-3 full-length practice exams
- [ ] Review incorrectly answered questions
- [ ] Quick review of all major topics
- [ ] Prepare exam logistics (ID, confirmation, location)
- [ ] Get adequate sleep every night (not just the night before!)

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Cram new material
- ❌ Take practice exams after Wednesday
- ❌ Study late the night before
- ❌ Make major schedule changes

---

### The Night Before

::: tip Get Good Sleep
8 hours of quality sleep is more valuable than 4 hours of last-minute studying.
:::

**Do:**
- [ ] Light review of key concepts only (30-60 minutes max)
- [ ] Organize materials for tomorrow (ID, confirmation email, etc.)
- [ ] Set multiple alarms
- [ ] Prepare clothes and breakfast
- [ ] Relax and destress (watch a movie, read, meditate)
- [ ] Go to bed early

**Don't:**
- ❌ Study intensively
- ❌ Learn new material
- ❌ Stay up late
- ❌ Consume excessive caffeine
- ❌ Stress about the exam

---

### Exam Day Morning

**2-3 hours before exam:**
- [ ] Eat a nutritious breakfast (protein + complex carbs)
- [ ] Moderate caffeine if you normally consume it
- [ ] Quick 10-15 minute review of notes (optional)
- [ ] Arrive at test center 15-30 minutes early (or log in early for online exams)

**What to bring (in-person exams):**
- Valid government-issued photo ID
- Exam confirmation/appointment details
- Any allowed reference materials (check exam rules)
- Water (if allowed)

---

## During the Exam

### Initial Setup (First 5 Minutes)

**Before starting questions:**

1. **Brain Dump** (if allowed)
   - Write down key formulas, commands, or mnemonics on scratch paper
   - Dump difficult-to-remember information immediately
   - Reference this throughout the exam

2. **Read Instructions Carefully**
   - Understand the exam format
   - Note the number of questions
   - Understand scoring (negative marking? unscored questions?)
   - Know if you can review/change answers

3. **Quick Breathing Exercise**
   - Take 3 deep breaths
   - Calm your nerves
   - Start with confidence

---

### Question-Answering Strategies

#### Strategy 1: First Pass - Answer What You Know

**Approach:**
1. Read each question carefully
2. If you know the answer confidently → answer and move on
3. If unsure → flag for review and move on
4. Don't spend more than 1-2 minutes per question initially

**Benefits:**
- Secures easy points quickly
- Builds confidence
- Maximizes time for difficult questions

---

#### Strategy 2: Time Management

**Calculate your time budget:**

Example: 85 questions, 120 minutes
- 120 minutes ÷ 85 questions = 1.4 minutes per question
- First pass: 1 minute per question = 85 minutes
- Second pass: 35 minutes for review and flagged questions

**Time checkpoints:**

| Time Elapsed | Questions Completed | Status |
|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| 30 minutes | ~25-30 questions | On track |
| 60 minutes | ~50-55 questions | On track |
| 90 minutes | ~75-80 questions | On track |
| 120 minutes | All questions | Done |

::: warning Running Behind?
If you're behind schedule:
- Speed up slightly on easier questions
- Make educated guesses on very difficult questions
- Ensure you answer all questions (no blanks)
:::

---

#### Strategy 3: Question-Reading Techniques

**Read carefully:**
- Identify keywords: "MOST", "LEAST", "NOT", "BEST", "EXCEPT"
- Look for scenario details (budget constraints, time limits, scale requirements)
- Understand what's being asked before looking at options

**Common question types:**

1. **"Which option is BEST/MOST appropriate?"**
   - Multiple answers might work
   - Choose the most optimal solution

2. **"Which options are correct? (Select TWO)"**
   - Must select exactly the number specified
   - All selected answers must be correct

3. **"What should you do FIRST?"**
   - Order matters
   - Choose the logical first step

4. **Scenario-based questions**
   - Read the scenario carefully
   - Identify constraints and requirements
   - Eliminate options that don't meet requirements

---

#### Strategy 4: Elimination Method

When unsure, eliminate obviously wrong answers:

**Step 1:** Cross out clearly incorrect options
**Step 2:** Analyze remaining options
**Step 3:** Choose the best answer from what's left

**Example:**
```
Question: Which AWS service is best for hosting a static website?

A) Amazon EC2        ← Eliminate (overkill for static site)
B) Amazon S3         ← Possible
C) Amazon RDS        ← Eliminate (database service)
D) Amazon CloudFront ← Possible (but used with S3)

Remaining: B and D
Answer: B (S3 is the primary service, CloudFront is optional)
```

---

#### Strategy 5: Look for Clues in Other Questions

**Sometimes later questions provide hints:**
- A concept mentioned in question 50 might help with question 20
- If you flagged a question, continue through the exam
- Review flagged questions after completing all others

---

### Managing Difficult Questions

**If you're stuck on a question:**

1. **Skip it temporarily**
   - Flag for review
   - Move on
   - Come back later with fresh eyes

2. **Rephrase the question**
   - What is this really asking?
   - What concept is being tested?

3. **Use the process of elimination**
   - Remove obviously wrong answers
   - Narrow down to 2-3 options

4. **Make an educated guess**
   - Never leave questions blank (unless negative marking)
   - Choose the most reasonable answer
   - Trust your first instinct if studied well

---

### Common Question Patterns

#### Pattern 1: "Choose the MOST cost-effective solution"

**What they're testing:** Cost optimization knowledge

**Approach:**
- Eliminate expensive services (managed > serverless > traditional)
- Look for reserved instances vs on-demand
- Consider data transfer costs
- Think about scaling efficiency

---

#### Pattern 2: "A company needs high availability..."

**What they're testing:** Architecture and resilience

**Look for:**
- Multi-AZ/multi-region deployments
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Redundancy

---

#### Pattern 3: "Ensure security and compliance..."

**What they're testing:** Security best practices

**Look for:**
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- IAM roles and policies (least privilege)
- Network security (VPC, security groups)
- Audit logging
- Compliance certifications

---

#### Pattern 4: "Migrate with LEAST operational overhead"

**What they're testing:** Managed vs self-managed solutions

**Choose:**
- Managed services over self-hosted
- Serverless over container/VM when appropriate
- Automated solutions over manual processes

---

### Second Pass - Review Flagged Questions

**After completing all questions:**

1. **Check time remaining**
2. **Prioritize flagged questions** by difficulty
3. **Review your answers** to flagged questions
4. **Change answers only if you're confident** you were wrong

::: warning Should I Change My Answer?
Only change an answer if:
- You have new information or insight
- You misread the question initially
- You're confident the new answer is correct

Don't change answers based on:
- Gut feeling
- Nervousness
- Second-guessing yourself
:::

## Exam Psychology

### Managing Test Anxiety

**Before/during exam:**

1. **Positive Self-Talk**
   - "I am well-prepared"
   - "I know this material"
   - "One question at a time"

2. **Breathing Exercises**
   - 4-7-8 technique: Breathe in (4 sec), hold (7 sec), exhale (8 sec)
   - Do this 2-3 times when feeling anxious

3. **Break Down the Task**
   - Don't think "85 questions to go"
   - Think "Just this one question"
   - Focus on the present question only

4. **Physical Reset**
   - Stretch shoulders/neck
   - Close eyes for 10 seconds
   - Take a short break if allowed

---

### Dealing with Difficult Questions

**Mental approach:**

✅ **Do:**
- Stay calm
- Read carefully
- Use elimination
- Make your best guess
- Move on

❌ **Don't:**
- Panic
- Spend too much time
- Let it affect other questions
- Give up

**Remember:**
- You don't need 100% to pass (usually ~70%)
- Missing a few hard questions is normal
- Focus on getting the others right

---

### Maintaining Focus

**Strategies for 2-hour exams:**

1. **Micro-breaks**
   - Close eyes for 5 seconds
   - Look away from screen
   - Stretch if needed

2. **Stay Hydrated**
   - Small sips of water
   - Don't overdrink (bathroom breaks count against time)

3. **Maintain Energy**
   - Don't skip breakfast
   - Avoid sugar crashes
   - Moderate caffeine intake

4. **Pace Yourself**
   - Sprint at start can lead to fatigue
   - Maintain steady, consistent pace

- Must select exact number specified
- ALL selected answers must be correct
- More challenging - be careful

::: tip Multiple Response Strategy
If you must select 2:
1. Find 2 you're confident about
2. If you only know 1, eliminate clearly wrong ones
3. Choose the most likely from remaining options
:::

---

### Case Studies/Scenario Questions

**Longer questions with multiple parts:**

**Approach:**
1. Read the scenario carefully (highlight key details)
2. Note the requirements and constraints
3. Understand what's being asked
4. Eliminate solutions that don't meet requirements
5. Choose best option from remaining choices
