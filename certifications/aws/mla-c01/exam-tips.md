## 🎯 Question-Answering Strategies

### Single-Answer Questions

**Strategy:**
1. Read the question carefully - look for keywords
2. Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
3. Compare remaining options
4. Choose the BEST answer (not just "correct")

**Common Keywords:**
- **"MOST"** - Compare all options, choose the best
- **"LEAST"** - Look for the exception or worst option
- **"First step"** - Focus on initial action, not the whole process
- **"Cost-effective"** - Usually means cheapest option
- **"Highly available"** - Focus on redundancy and failover
- **"Secure"** - Prioritize security features

### Multiple-Answer Questions

**Strategy:**
1. Question usually states "Select X answers" - must choose exactly X
2. Treat each option as true/false
3. Eliminate definite wrongs first
4. Select exactly the number requested

::: warning Common Trap
Multiple-answer questions may have 4-5 correct answers but only ask for 2-3. Choose the BEST ones.
:::

### Scenario-Based Questions

**Strategy:**
1. Read the scenario carefully - note requirements
2. Identify key constraints (budget, time, compliance, etc.)
3. Eliminate options that don't meet requirements
4. Choose solution that best fits all criteria

**Requirements Keywords:**
- "minimum cost" → Choose cheapest viable option
- "quickly" / "fastest" → Prioritize speed over complexity
- "scalable" → Choose solutions that can grow
- "compliant" → Must meet regulatory requirements
- "existing infrastructure" → Don't introduce new services

---

## 🚫 Common Exam Traps

### Trap 1: Over-Engineering

**Problem:** Choosing complex solutions when simple ones work

**Example:**
- ❌ Question asks for "quick deployment" → Answer suggests complex multi-step setup
- ✅ Look for simpler, faster solutions

**How to Avoid:**
- Read requirements carefully
- Don't assume complexity = better
- If it says "simple" or "quick", choose the straightforward option

---

### Trap 2: Missing Keywords

**Problem:** Ignoring important qualifiers in questions

**Common Missed Keywords:**
- "MOST cost-effective" (not just "works")
- "LEAST effort" (not most feature-rich)
- "immediate" (no time for planning)
- "minimum changes" (use existing setup)

**How to Avoid:**
- Underline/highlight keywords mentally
- Reread question if answer seems too easy
- Check that answer matches ALL requirements

---

### Trap 3: Assumption-Based Answers

**Problem:** Adding context not in the question

**Example:**
- ❌ "They probably need high availability" (not stated)
- ✅ Only answer what's explicitly asked or required

**How to Avoid:**
- Answer ONLY what's asked
- Don't add requirements not mentioned
- If in doubt, choose the simpler solution

---

### Trap 4: Similar-Looking Options

**Problem:** Two answers that seem almost identical

**Strategy:**
1. Read both options word-by-word
2. Find the ONE difference
3. That difference is the key to the question

**Example:**
```
Option A: [Service] with [Feature 1]
Option B: [Service] with [Feature 2]

The question is testing your knowledge of Feature 1 vs Feature 2
```

---

### Trap 5: "All of the Above" / "None of the Above"

**Strategy:**
- If you can identify even ONE wrong option, eliminate "All of the above"
- If you can identify even ONE correct option, eliminate "None of the above"
- These are often wrong answers designed to trap hasty readers
