#### 2. Foundation Model Applications (28%)
- ✅ RAG architecture and components
- ✅ Prompt engineering techniques
- ✅ When to use RAG vs. fine-tuning
- ✅ Model selection criteria
- ✅ Amazon Bedrock models and capabilities

#### 3. ML Fundamentals (20%)
- ✅ Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. reinforcement learning
- ✅ Overfitting vs. underfitting
- ✅ Precision vs. recall
- ✅ ML lifecycle phases

#### 4. Responsible AI (14%)
- ✅ Bias detection and mitigation
- ✅ Explainability importance
- ✅ SageMaker Clarify
- ✅ Human review with Amazon A2I

#### 5. Security and Governance (14%)
- ✅ Encryption at rest and in transit

### What NOT to Over-Study

::: tip Don't Waste Time On
- **Deep math** - No calculus or linear algebra required
- **Coding implementation** - Conceptual understanding, not code
- **Training algorithms** - Focus on use cases, not backpropagation
- **Specific pricing** - Know models, not exact costs
- **Advanced ML theory** - This is a practitioner exam, not data scientist
:::

---

## ⏱️ Time Management

### Exam Format
- **120 minutes** for **85 questions**
- About **1.4 minutes per question**
- Mix of multiple choice and multiple response

### Strategy

**First Pass (80 minutes)**:
- Answer questions you know
- Flag uncertain questions
- Don't spend more than 2 minutes per question

**Review Pass (35 minutes)**:
- Revisit flagged questions
- Eliminate wrong answers
- Make educated guesses

**Final Check (5 minutes)**:
- Ensure all answered
- Quick double-check of marked questions

::: danger No Negative Marking
Always answer every question. No penalty for wrong answers!

## 📝 Exam Day Tips

### Key Concepts to Memorize

#### AI/ML Hierarchy
```
AI (broadest)
 └─ ML (learn from data)
     └─ DL (neural networks)
```

#### Foundation Model Providers on Bedrock
- **Anthropic**: Claude (long context, reasoning)
- **Amazon**: Titan (text, embeddings, images)
- **AI21 Labs**: Jurassic (multilingual)
- **Cohere**: Command (text generation)
- **Meta**: Llama 2 (open-source)
- **Stability AI**: Stable Diffusion (images)

#### RAG Components
1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector database storage
4. Semantic search/retrieval
5. Context-augmented generation

#### Responsible AI Pillars
- **F**airness
- **E**xplainability
- **P**rivacy
- **S**afety
- **S**ecurity
- **T**ransparency
