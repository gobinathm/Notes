## How the Exam Wants You to Think

The AB-730 exam is for **Business Users**. It values **Safety, Efficiency, and Human Oversight**.

### Answer Philosophy
1.  **Trust but Verify**: If an answer suggests skipping human review, it's WRONG.
2.  **Specific is Better**: If two answers suggest a prompt, pick the one with more clear context/source.
3.  **Security First**: Microsoft loves questions about where data goes—remember: it stays in your **Tenant**.

## Keyword Detection Table

| If you see... | Look for this in the answer... |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| "False info" | **Hallucination** or **Fabrication** |
| "Company data" | **Microsoft Graph** or **Grounding** |
| "Real-time info" | **Web Search** toggle |
| "Tone is too dry" | **Rewrite** feature (Word/Outlook) |
| "Long email train" | **Summary by Copilot** |
| "Unreliable output" | **Human review** |

## Exam "Traps"

::: warning Look out for these!
- **Excel Formatting**: Choosing "Explain this chart" if the data isn't in a table yet. (Copilot needs the table format).
- **Data Training**: Answers that suggest Microsoft uses your data to train public models. (They don't).
- **Coding**: Any answer involving Python, JS, or API calls. (This is a non-technical exam).

## Final Strategy

- **Read the citatons**: In scenario questions, check if they mention where the data is coming from. 
- **Be the User**: Imagine yourself actually clicking the buttons in Word or Teams.
- **Responsible AI**: When in doubt, pick the most responsible/secure option.
